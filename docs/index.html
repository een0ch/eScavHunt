THIS is a clue to an online game that will begin sometime between DC27 and DC28. 

Clue #0								0x00005 

There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination.

To pass through the veil & embark on our quest
Seek a trio of tones; whichever the best

	One: 		Where time and space collide
	Two:		Where g0lden byt3s are plucked		D4cLbfAPQ1Ah/T9iXcSPMJ+zrqI=
	Three: 		Where birthdays tried			fICtzuf3wAZtrGYUjYip2l9zpxY=
	Four:		Is now unstuck
